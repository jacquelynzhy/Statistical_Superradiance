The code stored in this repository aims to reproduce the data utilized in the study by Zhu et al. in 2025. It comprises two Jupyter notebooks.

The first notebook, titled "Build Initial Data.ipynb," is utilized to generate identical initial conditions as those detailed in Section 3.1 of the paper. This notebook generates a pandas dataframe named "dataframe," which can be saved in a text file. This file contains the formatted initial conditions required as input for the ZEVN simulation. To construct the catalog, you will need to download ZEVN from https://gitlab.com/sevncodes/sevn (for additional information, refer to Spera et al. 2018) and run it using the file generated by this notebook. Alternatively, you can obtain Output1.dat from the Zenodo repository at the following link: https://zenodo.org/records/13981305.

The second Jupyter notebook, named "Output_BBH_Properties.ipynb," employs the text file named Output1.dat as an input file (which you can either download from the Zenodo repository or generate by running ZEVN).  Output1.dat is the output of ZEVN after it has been run with the initial conditions described before and after a selection of the property describing the name type of the remnant to select only BH-BH binaries. The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to produce the primary plots depicted in the paper, allowing you to evaluate their reproducibility and explore any modifications to the model that you are intersted in.
